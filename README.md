# Interactive Quiz

This project is to create an interactive quiz game that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions. The game will keep track of the user's score and display it at the end, while also providing a timer to limit the time for answering each question. The game will also provide feedback on the user's answers, indicating whether they are correct or incorrect.

The game will include several features to make it more engaging and enjoyable. These features include a start button to begin the game, a progress bar to display the user's progress through the quiz, randomized order of questions to make each game unique, multiple levels of difficulty, an option to skip questions or come back to them later, sound effects and animations, and the option to share the user's score on social media.
